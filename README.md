## My process
To build this site I used just plain HTML and CSS. There were two style files used. The first base.css is for the base layout which consisted of the default properties. Style.css is used to provide the styles for each class.
There is a assets folder that contains all css, images, and javascript needed.
Basic CSS was used for styling and flexbox to complete the design within three containers. Grid would have been a good option also for this project. Affinity Designer was used for the background graphic needed.
Tinypng to minimize all pictures on the website and Firebase to host the site.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a bit of flexbox can get you a long way in a simple design. Also, to start on mobile first and work outward to achieve the best results.

### Continued development

I want to focus on my naming conventions of styles and semantic names making sure im descriptive with both. I also want to learn more about how to auto-flow with flexbox (if possible) and start to use grid more to build my base layouts. 


### Useful resources

- [W3C Schools Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped with any questions about the structure or property I was a little foggy on. This is one of the best resources for web development I've found.

I want to thank Youtuber Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) for introducing me to the site during his live coding session. I do think this will help me on the journey to building my portfolio.
